-> You learned that Angular components display data.
-> You used the double curly braces of interpolation to display the app title.


Two-way binding
  -> Users should be able to edit the hero name in an <input> textbox.
  -> The textbox should both display the hero's name property and
      update that property as the user types.
      That means data flows from the component class out to the screen and
      from the screen back to the class.
  -> To automate that data flow, setup a two-way data binding between the <input> form element and the hero.name property.
  -> [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

-> You used the CLI to create a second HeroesComponent.
->  You displayed the HeroesComponent by adding it to the AppComponent shell.
->  You applied the UppercasePipe to format the name.
->  You used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive.
->  You learned about the AppModule.
->  You imported the FormsModule in the AppModule so that Angular would recognize and apply the ngModel directive.
->  You learned the importance of declaring components in the AppModule and appreciated that the CLI declared it for you.
