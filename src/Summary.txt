-> You learned that Angular components display data.
-> You used the double curly braces of interpolation to display the app title.

Two-way binding
  -> Users should be able to edit the hero name in an <input> textbox.
  -> The textbox should both display the hero's name property and
      update that property as the user types.
      That means data flows from the component class out to the screen and
      from the screen back to the class.
  -> To automate that data flow, setup a two-way data binding between the <input> form element and the hero.name property.
  -> [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.
